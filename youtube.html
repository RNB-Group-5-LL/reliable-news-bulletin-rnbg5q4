                        <p>We grew up in the society wherein older teach us that patience is always the key. From our experience, it is proven right, although sometimes, you might want to just give up because of complicated things. Creating a YouTube Channel really requires a long span of patience. Aside from you have a lot of popular competitors, it is really hard to gather audience since most of the people are attracted to those famous and already well-known channel.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">YouTube Experience</h2>
                        <p>YouTube has many ways and elements for creating, organizing, customizing, and even optimizing your channel. As we have started our YouTube Journey, we have explored different ways in executing these actions on our newly created channel, Reliable News Bulletin. </p>
                        <p>During the video production process of our team, the most challenging part was the editing phase as it requires great effort and patience. Moreover, the main purpose of editing videos is to capture your viewers’ attention which then required the team to look for a way to do so. In addition, creating a channel on YouTube has been a great experience, especially during the times when we have marketed our channel in order to gain not only viewers but also likes, comments, and even subscribers for our videos.</p>
                        <p>Overall, our team is contented and satisfied with what we have done for our YouTube Channel as a group. Below are their specific insights with the questions asked:</p>
                        <blockquote>1. How was having a team helpful in creating your YouTube channel, RNB?</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                               <span></span> 
                               Although I was used to working solo, now I realized it feels so great to have such an active and competent team when it comes to creating a YouTube channel. It is very observable that even famous solo bloggers or YouTubers have a team that has specified tasks when it comes to the content itself. It is quite nice that you have a team to distribute the tasks, not compiling all the activities needed to be done by yourself.

                            <li>
                                <span></span> 
                                It makes the work easier and it avoids us from procrastination and boredom because we have teammates we can talk to while doing the activities and we get to share our thoughts with others for them to gain more knowledge about the work. 
                             </li>

                                <span></span> 
                                Having a team was helpful since all tasks won't get given to you which takes a long time and energy. Having a team is also helpful for idealization so that they can give ideas that you can't give.
                             </li>

                             <li>

                             Having a team was very helpful in creating a Youtube Channel. Having a team made creating and managing a channel a lot easier. It is also helpful when we are thinking or when brainstorming new ideas for our content, as we share ideas and thoughts, we can choose and decide what topic we will be covering easier.

                                <span></span>
                                Creating our YouTube Channel, RNB, was challenging, especially during parts where the process is not familiar. However, having a team resolved these problems. In addition, by working together and giving insights to each other, we have continuously identified an answer to each of our questions which then made all the given tasks easier.

                        <blockquote>2. Are you satisfied with what you have done? If not, how do you plan to be better?</blockquote>

                               When it comes to activities, I usually don't really set high standards or expect so good when it comes to the work of others. But when it comes to my own works, I don't criticize them, and I don't brag about anything as well. For the overall work of the group, I'm quite satisfies, it's not disappointing at all. The activities done by the whole group are decent, neat, and presentable. So I can no longer see any reason to be disappointed or unsatisfied with the group wors. After all, I can say that I'm satisfied, but still, I am always open for improvements, that's why we plan to always gather feedbacks from others to imporve our work in any aspect.

                                Yes, I am satisfied, and I plan to be better by giving more feedback to my teammates so they know what's bothering me regarding our activities and I hope others would as well.

                             <li>
                                <span></span> 
                                Yes, I am satisfied with what I've done. It is a few but is is enough I guess.
                             </li>

                             <li>
                                 <span></span> 
                                 Seeing our work allows me to gain confidence about the upcoming activities to be given. Thus, I can say that I am satisfied with the output of our group. However, I believe that we can make it a lot better and improve through receiving honest feedback from others.
                             </li>

                             <li>

                                 I was not that satisfied with how I have done. I think I could have done more for the team, and given more ideas by voicing out my thoughts more.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">YouTube Analytics Analysis</h2>
                        <p>YouTube Analytics allows an individual to view its channel’s statistics. It shows your earnings per view, video viewing statistics, viewers’ demography, engagement rate, and growth of viewers count which could greatly help your channel grow more. Furthermore, analyzing your YT Analytics allows you to stay focused on the most important aspects of your goal. It assesses potential channel blockages and how to overcome them, allowing you to set more realistic goals and keep a positive attitude along the way.</p>
                       <p>RNB’s YT Analytics as of March 31, 2022, several days after the posting of the first video, reached 27 subscribers, 205 views, and 2.5 hours for the watch time. Impressions got 200, Impression Click-Through Rate got 44%, while unique viewers reached 68. And lastly, the average view duration of RNB’s first video is 0:43 seconds.</p>
                       <p>We see that there is still space for improvement in which we are eager to achieve in posting more of our videos through continuously analyzing and looking for content that are liked by a number of viewers.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Learnings & Realizations</h2>
                        <p>Knowing your target audience and their habits may help you adapt your videos, expand your reach, and transform your channel into a destination for viewers. We have also realized that analyzing YouTube Analytics enables you to compare your channel’s content to other channels, allowing you to see what content viewers find more interesting, giving you ways on how to improve your channel. Thus, it is necessary to be fully aware of this as it can help your channel grow more and become better. </p>
                        <p>In the possible near future, if there’s a chance that we decide to become YouTubers, we’d be able to use these learnings and realizations in our channel and become successful workers.</p>
